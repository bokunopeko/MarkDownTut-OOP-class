INT. UNITED DEFENSE FORCES DROPSHIP - IN FLIGHT - STORM
SOUND: Someone breathing, GASPING for breath they're so
afraid. And the HIGH-PITCHED WHINE of RAMJETS laboring
against heavy side-winds as we struggle to focus on -
- OPEN OCEAN. CHURNING, whipping past at a couple hundred
miles an hour, 800 feet below a SOLDIER'S DANGLING BOOTS.
CAGE (V.O.)
What am I doing here?
PVT. BILLY CAGE is maybe 20. Too young for this. COLD SWEAT
trickles into his eyes. When he tries to wipe it away, his
ARMORED FINGERS CLACK against clear ACRYLIC. His FACEPLATE.
Cage is wearing an EXOJACKET: powered, tight-fitting body
armor, bristling with weaponry. TWO DOZEN OTHER young,
terrified SOLDIERS hang with him, also jacketed, dangling
over the OPEN BAY DOORS, over OCEAN.
Cage taps a button. His faceplate opens, NOISE floods in at a
DEAFENING ROAR. He rubs his eyes -
YONABURU
Don't poke yer eye out, bud.
PVT. YONABURU, a hard-ass fuckup with Asian features but a
Southern drawl - Cage's battle-buddy - smiles.
SGT. FARELL
GET YOUR PLATE SHUT, PRIVATE!
FROM UP FRONT, BATTLE-SCARRED SGT. FARELL shoots them a look.
ACROSS from Cage, GRIFF, 25, a burly-looking bad-ass, keeps
making an about-to-vomit face, barely fighting back the urge.
SGT. FARELL (CONT'D)
